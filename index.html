    <h1 style="color:rgb(32, 181, 231);">A short story of two animals.</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, there were two close friends - the frog and the mouse. 
        The frog often met the mouse at his house as they both share the food and
        provision stocked by the mouse. One day, the frog asked the mouse to come
        to his house. The frog said, “Dear mouse, I come to your house all the time, 
        now, I invite you to come to my place”. The mouse replied, “Your house is across
        the stream. I don’t know how to swim. I'm scared of drowning”. The frog said, “You 
        don’t panic, I have a beautiful plan for you. You come and climb on my back and I will
        tie you to me with a strong blade of grass. With this, you can safely cross the stream.
        The mouse immediately agreed to this and they both set out. Halfway across the stream,
        the frog thought of eating the mouse. He thought: “If I let the mouse drown, I 
        can get all his stocked food and I don't need to take much heed about being
        hungry for a long time.” So, the wicked frog dives for the bottom of the stream. 
        As the mouse realized the dishonesty of the frog, he started crying for help.
        “Help me! Help me!” cried the mouse. A hawk flying above the stream saw this
        scene and dived down to help the mouse. The hawk held him with its beak and
        began to fly high in the sky. The frog tied to the mouse's back also flew away. 
        In the end, the frog realized his mistake. In his greed to get more and more food,
        he had not only lost the trust of his good friend but also put his own life in danger.
